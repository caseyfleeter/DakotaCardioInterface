# Documentation for Dakota Git Repo	

## General Notes
This project contains a framework for the Dakota-Simvascular coupled uncertainty quantification workflow. This project is designed to be customized to fit specific user desires. The framework couples Dakota to the Simvascular cardiovascular flow solvers, and can be adapted to utilize any of Dakota’s many features.

The files provided here were adapted from files for MLMF uncertainty quantification using three mesh levels each of high- and low-fidelity models. This framework is flexible in the sense that any number of mesh levels for high and low fidelity models can be added to the framework

Additionally, by changing the `dakota_MLMF_[3D-1D, 3D-1D-0D]_template.in` file, additional uncertainty quantification techniques, optimization, or parameter estimation techniques implemented in DAKOTA can be used with the Simvascular flow solvers.

## Dependencies not included here
To utilize this framework, the user needs to install the DAKOTA framework from Sandia National Labs (found at [Dakota | Explore and predict with confidence](https://dakota.sandia.gov)) and the Simvascular framework (found at [SimVascular](https://simvascular.github.io) and https://github.com/SimVascular/oneDSolver ). 

It is assumed the user will follow the installation instructions from both of those sites to install the needed executables for this coupled framework. 

## Further Details
More detailed documentation can be found in the `Documentation` directory. 

Below are details for how to specifically edit each provided template file to run simulations.
